## What is this project about

El Statistician is a project for calculating and comparing different descriptive and inferential statistics. What is interesting about it is that you can enter the samples yourself or import CSV datasets directly and filter them as needed. Also, it enables the user to save the results in a history for comparing different results or reviewing them later.

## Getting started

You can find the app <a href="https://el-statistician.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.
The app and the API were deployed using free services, so it might cause delays and crashes but would be sufficient for testing.
